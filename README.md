## ‚öôÔ∏è File Size Management

By default, the script automatically selects the **smallest available file** to ensure smooth playback. However, you can customize this behavior using the username field:

### üéØ Default Behavior
- **Username**: `anything`
- **Result**: Selects the smallest file available

### üéÆ Custom File Size Preference
- **Username**: `filesize:4`
- **Result**: Prefers files ‚â§4GB, but will play larger files if that's all that's available

### üìä Examples
| Username | Target Size | Behavior |
|----------|------------|----------|
| `filesize:2` | ‚â§2GB | Targets smaller files for mobile/limited bandwidth |
| `filesize:5.5` | ‚â§5.5GB | Balanced quality and performance |
| `filesize:10` | ‚â§10GB | Higher quality for fast connections |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Higher file sizes may cause buffering or stuttering during peak traffic periods on the a.111477.xyz servers. For best performance, stick with smaller file sizes.
